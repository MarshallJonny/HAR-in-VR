# HAR-in-VR
Human Activity Recognition in VR using the Unity Game Engine (Bachelors Thesis Project)

Overview Presentation: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1523ZHHmrStjAHNMIT7D9o9F1c1HbW3YaOy5r4rDlWXE/edit?usp=sharing

Open the Project using Unity Editor Version 2022.3.12f1, or simply run "HAR in VR.exe" from the "Builds" folder. Be careful when using a VR headset. Its currently simulated using [XR Device Simulator](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.interaction.toolkit@2.0/manual/xr-device-simulator.html) (ie. it works without a headset and might couse problems if you use one)
